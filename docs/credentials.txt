export EDITOR=vim
rails credentials:edit
creates config/master.key if none exists already
save that master.key in safe password sharing place (not github)
.gitignore keeps config/master.key out of github
if you lose it, you have to start over with new config/credentials.yml.enc

format of file is like:
aws:
  access_key_id: xyz
  secret_access_key: abc

and used like:

  access_key_id: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:aws, :access_key_id) %>
  secret_access_key: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:aws, :secret_access_key) %>
