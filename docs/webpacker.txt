ultimately just did what it suggested changing:
environments/development.rb to check_yarn_integrity = false

see https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/1374

was seeing about running webpacker compiler but get error like:
[4/4] 📃  Building fresh packages...

Using /workspace/things/config/webpacker.yml file for setting up webpack paths


========================================

  Please run `yarn install` to update.

To disable this check, please add `config.webpacker.check_yarn_integrity = false`
to your Rails development config file (config/environments/development.rb).


yarn check v1.7.0
warning Integrity check: Flags don't match
error Integrity check failed

but attempts to add NODE_DEV=development to .env and prepended to command
line still make certain commands fail including just:

NODE_DEV=
NODE_ENV=development rails webpacker:compile

NODE_ENV=development rails webpacker:compile
NODE_ENV=development rails webpacker:compile

but
rails webpacker:compile would fail with "integrity check"
which appears to be related to :0
