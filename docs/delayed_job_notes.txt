config/initialiers/delayed_job.rb has default settings

spring stop was necessary before .delay method could be found

bundle exec rails install delayed_job generates bin/delayed_job

tmp/pids holds pid files for runners but otherwise overmind and foreman exit

bin/delayed_job status
doesn't show anything running unless you match Procfile syntax exactly like:
bin/delayed_job status -n 2 --queue=batch

keep getting "already a process running" error when using -n 2

issue is that the base name is delayed_job.n when you do -n 2
and it doesn't differ based on the queues you launch.
Can't specify identifier and count at same time so best
we can do is add one line in Procfile for every instance we want
